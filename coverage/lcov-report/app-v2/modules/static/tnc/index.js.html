          &lt;h1 className="f16 fw7 mb4"&gt;Limitation of liability for fault not attributable to TT&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p className="f14p mb15"&gt;
            You agree and acknowledge that TT will have the right of indemnification
            for any loss that may be caused to TT for any misuse of its Website or
            App, by you and TT will have all rights to approach the appropriate
            court of law for enforcement of such rights.
          &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="f14p mb15"&gt;
            TT and/or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors,
            employees, agents or suppliers and their respective successors, heirs
            and permitted assigns will not be liable for any loss that you may
            suffer due to rejection of your visa, hotel cancellation policies and/or
            any other policy of third parties service providers who are involved in
            the product that you purchase from TT.
          &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="f14p mb15"&gt;
            It shall be your obligation to ensure that your passport is valid and
            eligible for undertaking international travel. TT and/or its parents,
            subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
            suppliers and their respective successors, heirs and permitted assigns
            will not be liable for passport being declared ineligible for entry/exit
            during or prior to undertaking the international travel. Given below,
            are certain essential do’s and don’ts with respect to your passport:
          &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div className="f14p mb15 pl24"&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
                Validity of passports should be at least 6 months from date of return;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;Hand written passports will not be considered valid;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;Passports must have barcode;&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;Passports should not be mutilated or tampered; and&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
                Name on passport should match with name on other documents provided
                for visa.
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;h1 className="f16 fw7 mb4"&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p className="f14p mb15"&gt;
            Neither TT nor any of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,
            directors, employees, agents or suppliers and their respective
            successors, heirs and permitted assigns shall be responsible for, or be
            deemed to be in default on account of, any failure to perform or due to
            delay in performance of any of its obligations hereunder, in whole or in
            part, if such performance is rendered impracticable by the occurrence of
            acts of war, whether declared or undeclared, sabotage, embargo, acts of
            terrorism, riot or other civil commotion, failure in transportation, act
            of any government or any court or administrative agency thereof, acts of
            God, fire, explosion, flood, earthquake, strike, act of government or
            other catastrophes, epidemics or quarantine restrictions, or other
            cause(s) beyond the reasonable control of TT (“Force Majeure”). Both you
            and TT shall use their best efforts to avoid, overcome and offset the
            effects of any cause or potential cause of an event of Force Majeure.
            Upon cessation of the cause of the Force Majeure, the Terms of Use given
            hereunder, shall again become fully operative. However, a Force Majeure
            event will not relieve you or TT of the obligations accrued prior to the
            occurrence of the Force Majeure.
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
