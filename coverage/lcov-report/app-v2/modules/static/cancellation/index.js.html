const Cancellation = () =&gt; (
  &lt;div className="clearfix p24"&gt;
    &lt;h1 className="f24 fw9 mb15 pb8"&gt;Cancellation/ Modification Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p className="f14p mb15"&gt;
    TravelTriangle believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has
    therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div className="f14p mb15 pl24"&gt;
    &lt;ul &gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 72
        hours of placing an order. However, the cancellation request will not be
        entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
        vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        There is no cancellation of orders placed under the Same Day Delivery
        category.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        No cancellations are entertained for those products that the
        TravelTriangle marketing team has obtained on special tours like Group
        Tour, etc. These are limited occasion offers and therefore cancellations
        are not possible.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        In case you feel that the product (trip) received is not as shown on the
        site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our
        customer service within 24 hours of receiving the product. The Customer
        Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate
        decision.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        {' '}
        TT or its affiliate partners will not be liable for any Visa rejections
        and Hotel cancellation policies would still stand as they are.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Refunds can only be given in cases of inclusions mentioned in package
        confirmed by customer are not delivered by booking agent. Refunds will
        not be given in any other case.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        If due to unforeseen circumstances, the traveler has to pay for the
        inclusions already mentioned in the package, refund claims for the
        inclusions part of the package may be considered and refunded upon
        submission of proper receipts, provided this was pre-informed to Travel
        Triangle advisor or travel agent.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Travel Triangle guarantees delivery of services booked through Travel
        Triangle. In case part package is booked by traveler themselves or
        outside of Travel Triangle, no claim against such services shall be
        entertained.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        In case local attractions are closed for maintenance/weather
        conditions/government orders/strike/curfew/natural calamity/other
        unforeseen reasons, Travel Triangle/travel agent will try its best to
        reimburse the traveler appropriate amount against the same in case
        refund is possible. However, Travel Triangle/travel agent are not
        obligated for the same and cannot be held liable against it.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2 className="f24 fw7 mb15 pb8 pt24"&gt;Refund Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p className="f14p mb8"&gt;Under this policy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div className="f14p mb15 pl24"&gt;
    &lt;ul &gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        If you are, for any reason, not entirely happy with your purchase, we
        will cheerfully issue applicable refund provided such refund is sought
        pursuant to cancellation and the request for same is made within 72
        hours of your purchase and shall be further subject to the travel agent
        having not processed your order.To request a refund, simply contact us
        with your purchase details within three (3) days of your purchase.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Please include your order number (sent to you via email after ordering)
        and optionally tell us why you’re requesting a refund - we take customer
        feedback very seriously and use it to constantly improve our products
        and quality of service. Refunds are being processed within 21 days
        period however, we shall not be liable for any default caused in
        processing the refund amount owing to the delay caused by processing
        bank.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Any amendments/additions to package (dates, inclusions, itinerary etc),
        will be done at extra cost to the customer. Changes made to the package
        will be made as per cancellation policy of the original package and
        customer has to bear the cost incurred due to this.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Travel Triangle doesn't encourage changes and modifications to online
        bookings once they're made. However, facilitation of changes related to
        postponement or rescheduling of the already booked package is the sole
        discretion of Travel agent under permitted circumstances. Travel
        Triangle shall not be held liable for any impact due to change in
        original itinierary by the traveler and this is subject to mutual
        agreement and discussion between traveler and travel agent.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        In case of force majeure cases (such as curfew, riots etc), Travel
        Triangle shall not be liable for any losses made thereof.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li className="mb8"&gt;
        Circumstances amounting to “force majeure” include any event which we or
        the supplier of the service(s) in question could not even with all due
        care, foresee or forestall such as (by way of example and not by way of
        limitation) war, threat of war, riot, civil strife, industrial dispute,
        terrorist activity, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, acts of God,
        adverse weather conditions, and all similar events.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
